# Project 3
+ By: *Gerald Walden*
+ Production URL: <http://p3.geraldbrentwalden.me>

## Outside resources
I looked a few times at pages under *https://www.w3schools.com/php/* for quick answers to basic syntax questions.
I briefly consulted Stack Overflow on includes--
    <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21753954/how-to-include-a-sub-view-in-blade-templates>

## 3 Unique inputs
"Unit Type" radio button form -- Choose to convert units of distance (km/mi), temperature(C/F) or mass (kg/lbs)
"Conversion" dropdown option menu -- Choose Imperial to Metric, or Metric to Imperial.
"Value to convert" text-box for numerical entry; user enters value to be converted.

## Packages
I included and made use of *barryvdh/laravel-debugbar*
Did not end up using any other packages.
